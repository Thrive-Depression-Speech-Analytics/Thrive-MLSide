# Thrive-MLSide

This project proposes a mobile application leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect potential signs of depression through speech analysis. Users can record or upload short audio samples of speech, and the app will analyze vocal characteristics like pitch, intonation, and speech disfluencies. By employing machine learning models trained on a comprehensive dataset of labeled voice recordings, the app aims to identify patterns potentially associated with depression or mental health concerns. 

This is the ML Side of Thrive, where we use DAIC-WOZ dataset to train the ML models using CNN algorithm.
